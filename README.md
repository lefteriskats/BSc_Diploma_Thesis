# My_BSc_Diploma_Thesis

The thesis I completed for my Bachelor's degree in Physics at the Department of Electronics and Computers at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki titled "Wireless sampling and representation of temperature and humidity data with ESP32 microcontroller".

For your convenience with file manipulation in the SD card and SPIFFS memory of the ESP32, copy and paste the two sketches folders of the "Useful Arduino sketches" in your Arduino sketchbook directory.
